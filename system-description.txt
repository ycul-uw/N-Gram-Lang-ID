The system is structured as follows:

1. **Directories**:
    - `src/`: Contains the source code for the system.
    - `src/Code/`: Stores the trained N-gram language models.
    - `src/Input/`: Contains the training datasets.
    - `src/Output/`: Stores the output files, such as predictions and evaluation metrics.
    - `src/Validation/`: Stores the testing datasets, including an asnwer key to the testing data.

2. **Files**:
    - `src/Code/letterLangId.ipynb`: Script for training the N-gram language models based on letter.
    - `src/Code/wordLangId.ipynb`: Script for training the N-gram language models based on word with Add-One smoothing.
    - `src/Code/wordLangId2.ipynb`: Script for training the N-gram language models based on word with Good-Turing smoothing.
    - `src/Validation/LangID.test`: Testing datasets.
    - `src/Validation/labels.sol`: Answer key to the testing data.
    - `README.md`: Provides an overview of the system and instructions for usage.
    - `N-Gram Models Analysis.pdf`: Detailed analysis of the advantage and usage of each models, their differences, and implimentation details.

3. **Execution**:
    - Run the files in `src/Code` to train the models using the datasets in `src/Data/Input`.
    - Outputs will be automatically placed in `src/Data/Output`
    - Evaluate of the predictions/accuracy of each model is displayed at the end of each model files.
